=========================
NISMOD v2 Transport Model
=========================

**NISMOD v2 Transport Model** is a national-scale (*Great Britain*) transport model developed to support policy making 
regarding future infrastructure. It forecasts the impact of various endogenous and exogenous factors on transport 
demand and capacity utilisation, following an elasticity-based simulation methodology. The model consists of three submodels 
covering the following modes of transport: **road** (passenger and freight vehicle flows), **rail** (total station usage), and **air** (passenger and flight movements).
