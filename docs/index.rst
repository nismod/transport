NISMOD v2 Transport Model
=========================

NISMOD v2 Transport Model is a national-scale (Great Britain) transport model developed to support policy making 
regarding future infrastructure. It forecasts the impact of various endogenous and exogenous factors on transport 
demand and capacity utilisation, following an elasticity-based simulation methodology. The modelling suite consists 
of three models covering: road traffic (passenger and freight vehicle flows), rail (total station usage) and air (passenger and flight movements).
