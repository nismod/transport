Road Model
----------

*	NISMOD v2 Transport Model predicts vehicle demand (inter-zonal flows) for passenger and freight vehicles, and stochastically simulates road traffic on all major UK roads including A-roads and motorways.
*	It is currently the only national-scale road traffic model capable of routing-based network assignment and provisioning a national-scale origin-destination matrix (on TEMPRo & LAD spatial zoning levels), while achieving a respectable match with AADF traffic counts, total vehicle kilometres, expected number of car trips, and the observed trip length distribution from the National Travel Survey. 
*	The freight model has been modelled after the DfTâ€™s 2006 Base-Year Freight Matrices model, which includes traffic flows for freight vehicles (vans, rigid HGVs, and articulated HGVs) between local authority districts (LADs), sea ports, selected airports, and major distribution centres. The accuracy of the freight model is mostly limited by the spatial zoning system (LAD).
*	The demand prediction model is elasticity-based and it can predict future vehicle flows from exogenous (scenario-based) changes in population and GVA, and endogenously calculated changes in inter-zonal travel time and travel cost (but also dependent on exogenous interventions such as new road development and congestion charging policies).
*	Congested travel times on individual road links have been modelled separately for each hour of the day, using the speed-flow curves estimated on English roads (DfT's 2005 FORGE model), the overcapacity formula from WebTAG, and the passenger car unit (PCU) concept to capture different vehicle sizes.
*	The number of lanes on each road segment has been estimated by map-matching AADF count point locations to the OpenRoads major road network. This has allowed a distinction between single and dual carriageway A-roads, which are then assumed to have 1 and 2 lanes per direction, respectively.
*	The network assignment exists in two version and it has been implemented using state-of-the-art routing algorithms. The routing version uses a heuristic search algorithm A* to find the fastest path between two locations using congested link travel times, while the route-choice version uses an advanced discrete-choice model (path-size logit) to choose the optimal path based on distance, travel time, travel cost (fuel and road tolls), and the number of intersections.
*	The route-choice version of the network assignment uses a route set pre-generated on the IRIDIS cluster of the *University of Southampton*. This pre-generated route set consists of more than 90 million different route options which enables the national-scale assignment to run within minutes, despite each individual vehicle trip being simulated separately (including time of day choice, engine type choice, route choice).
*	The model can also incorporate scenarios for changes in vehicle fuel efficiency and changes in market shares of different engine types, including internal combustion engines on petrol, diesel, LPG, hydrogen or CNG; hybrid EVs on petrol or diesel; plug-in hybrid EVs on petrol or diesel; fuel cell EVs on hydrogen, and battery EV. This can be used to test policies such as the fossil fuel phase-out.
* 	Electricity and fuel consumptions are calculated using the four-parameter formula from WebTAG. Behavioural assumptions are made for plug-in hybrid EVs (electricity on urban, fuel on rural road links).
*	Interventions such as new road development, road expansion with new lanes, and congestion charging zones can be dynamically implemented in each simulated year.
*	The model can output various metrics on the road link level (e.g. road capacity utilisation, peak hour travel times), zonal level (e.g. vehicle kilometres, EV electricity consumption), inter-zonal level (e.g. predicted vehicle flows, average travel times, average travel costs) and national level (e.g. total CO2 emissions, total energy consumptions). The outputs are in csv and shapefile format, allowing them to be visualised with a software of choice.

Rail Model Key Features
-----------------------

*	NISMOD v2 Transport Model also includes a national-scale rail model for predicting future station usage demand.
*	It currently uses station usage data for 3054 stations covering National Rail, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway, London Trams (previously Croydon Tramlink), Manchester Metrolink, and Tyne & Wear (Newcastle) Metro.
*	Elasticity-based demand model predicts station usage (entry + exit) from exogenous inputs including: population, GVA, rail fare index, generalised journey time (GJT) index and car trip costs.
*	Car trip costs can be provided as an input or calculated from the outputs of the NISMOD road model.
*	Elasticities of rail fares and GJT vary per elasticity zone (London Travelcard, South-East, PTE, other).
* 	The model implements a policy intervention for building new rail stations in future years.
